# Labor Inefficiency and the Lobbying Problem

## The problem:

Inefficiency in labor - the free market doesn't protect against flagrant inefficiency in certain cases - legal scammers do not provide a useful service and only succeed in wasting a ton of productivity - where to draw the line? There is such a thing as unproductive behavior that still generates money - this is a flaw in capitalism. Examples include behavior aimed at taking advantage of others - various forms of solicitation, scamming, lobbying

Once an entity gets sufficiently large, they are no longer beholden to the system that works so well on a small scale - they can create their own good because they are powerful enough to totally influence the market
