# The New Tenure

## How good work will be done post-automation

Book idea: the new tenure: how financial freedom allows modern creatives to address pressing problems outside of academia (and why academia sucks)
There are too many clout chasers in academia - the initial point of tenure has been defeated by a massive influx of persons and a shift in the motivation behind science and research (in america?)
Figures of public research funded by private entities
The endless cycle of publishing that everyone finds themselves in is to the detriment of the academic community - mirroring trends in modern social media platforms, the shift of focus to perceived volume of research rather than the impact of the research, overflows the area of study with literature that only slows progress - it’s harder than ever to do literature reviews because of the sheer volume of papers
Get figures on how useful the average paper or study is
Acknowledge that this is how the academic model is supposed to perform - lots of random research done will lead to the occasional breakthrough - but what if there was a better way for bringing practical implementations of research to the market and to the public
Many professors start companies based off of their work - why wait until you are a prof to do this?
You can do it on your own with a small grant
Meanwhile, during the decline of academia, multiple information stores (also peer-reviewed, but far more informational and helpful) have arisen - the humble content creator - there is an issue with quality here as well, but the outlook is better than academia for *these* reasons
Alternative route to producing good and useful work: forming a non-profit and getting a grant for an issue that is pressing and stimulating
Also need to address the large amount of resources available to professors - this makes hardware projects more difficult
Why is this youtuber, working alone and on their own budget more effective than a lab out of ?? Implicit of a problem in academia
You don’t need to go through advanced classes to learn how to conduct research, especially if the institution that is teaching you is corrupt
Need to address high-level research that does depend on advanced knowledge/methods
Need to address desire to teach advanced individuals

Problem solving for the improvement of the human condition: there is no way to guarantee outcomes, but there are better mechanisms than capitalism to use when deciding what work to do - this ties into responsibility to society and your fellows	

While in the Galapagos and learning more about Darwin, it is once again vary palin how a safe and free environment are critical for useful throught and creative and impactful work

Darwin would not have been able to develop his theory without freedom and the educational and monetary resources of his family

As automation eliminates the need for everyone to be traditionally productive, individuals from all walks of life may find themselves in this 'New Tenure'

Along with general humanism, promoting this New Tenure should be central to the impact I wish to make

The resources to be top university-educated are out there for free, however people cannot use this to its full effect - is this because a certain environment and background is required alongside the material?
