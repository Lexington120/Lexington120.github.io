# Good Work

## Subtitle

This post is central to all of my work going forward - define my values and what I believe is required for 'good work'

Humanism - everyone is me and has worth (driving value)
Courage - vulnerability leads to personal growth
Inspiration - creativity and passion drive innovation
Loyalty - commit to and trust the good people around you
Wellness - healthy body, healthy mind, before all work
Respect - everyone deserves to be met with open ears and eyes initially
Awareness - understand how you are influencing everything around you - strive to guarantee a positive impact (relies on knowledge)
Knowledge - informed decisions are the only responsible decisions
Ego - you can deal with anything as long as you understand what you are
Purpose - you are in a position to help others due to your privilege and you must act

Attention + depth = good work

The world has a problem with quality. Cheap, replacible hardware is favored over the good stuff - content is pumped out in volume in an attempt to catch just a moment of your attention for profit - good people act on poorly-motivated thoughts and fail to impact the world in the way that they desire.

With this site, I am trying to not contribute to the veritable landfill of content that currently exists on the web. I am also trying to refine my thoughts and values in order to improve myself and enable myself to do good.


Let’s write something useful:
If I am not going to engage in all modern tragedies, then I really need to commit to my reasoning for doing so
1. There is not enough time/effort for an individual to make an informed and meaningful decision on all major global events (that their country may influence)
That’s really all there is to it… however, in order to be useful, I need to help out with some of these issues that I make an effort to be educated and impactful on
The world will be saved by powerful free-thinkers: the people that have the time to investigate certain important problems and implement their resources (creativity, money, physical effort) in an effort to solve them

Finding trustworthy sources of information is non-trivial

The search for quality: everyone is making under informed decisions and acting on poorly motivated intentions - everyone needs to be a deep thinker, but not everyone can be - so now what? - also address information gathering and proving unknowable things to yourself statistically - review freedom of the mind
