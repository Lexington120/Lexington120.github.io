How can we trust information that is gathered by people that are not ourselves without relying on their integrity

If someone wishes to fudge experimental results right now, it is fairly easy to do so. Simply open your CSV in an editor, change some numbers and now you have a dataset that is not accurate, yet presents identically to your peers.

We can extend this to more complicated information and more complicated editing tools. If you with to change or fabricate video and audio data, there exist many tools that allow you to do that and disguise that fact.

Much of the digital informaiton that exists today is not menually entered into a computer by a human, but created by a transducer from environmental readings.

We now have at our disposal modern cryptographic techniques that can guarantee certain information in certain contexts. How can we use these techniques to guarantee that information created by transducers can be trusted by even the people that were not involved in the experiment?
