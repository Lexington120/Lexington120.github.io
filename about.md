Hello, I am Brad Greer

Dead Reckoning is a primitive integration technique that can be applied with practical methods to produce a useful outcome. Brain-Dead implies the loss of all neurologic function. Their combination in the title of this site is a nod to both my desire to make an impact with the implementation of good theory, as well as self-depricating commentary on how I go about doing this. Also I just like word play.

It's hard to engage with blogs. In recognition of this, I have made an effort to produce engaging, quality content on topics that I think are important. If you feel compelled to engage with me past reading, please send me an email.

Enjoy
