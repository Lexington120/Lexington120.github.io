I run this site to host content that I care about. This content covers a wide variety of subjects - really anything that I think is interesting or potent.

Any good work that I would like to share is under 'Thoughts'. 'Art' is more of a portfolio with work at varying stages of quality and completion.

Dead Reckoning is a primitive integration technique that can be applied with practical methods to produce a useful outcome. Brain-Dead implies the loss of all neurologic function. Their combination in the title of this site is a nod to both my desire to make an impact with the implementation of good theory, as well as self-depricating commentary on how I go about doing this. Also I just like word play.

I am always looking to expand my horizons and meet and work with new people. If anything in this blog speaks to you, please do not hesitate to reach out.
