I have this site to host content that I care about. This content covers a wide variety of subjects - really anything that I think is interesting or potent.

Dead Reckoning is a primitive integration technique that can be applied with practical methods to produce a useful outcome. Brain-Dead implies the loss of all neurologic function. Their combination is a nod to both my desire to make an impact with the implementation of good theory, as well as self-depricating commentary on how I go about doing this.

I find that doing good work is like swimming in muddy water; you must trade off taking in your surroundings and heading with your head up, and strong strokes with your head down. This balance between global and local action optimization requires a careful implementation of Dead Reckoning to ensure you end up where you want to be.

I am always looking to expand my horizons and meet and work with new people. If anything in this blog speaks to you, please do not hesitate to reach out.
